        Hi, I'm a dedicated and detail-oriented web developer with over 1 year of experience crafting dynamic, user-friendly, and responsive web applications. I thrive on turning ideas into functional, visually appealing solutions that address real-world challenges. With expertise in Frontend and Backend development—particularly in the MERN Stack—I have successfully built projects that showcase my skills in creating seamless user experiences and efficient backend systems. My commitment to continuous learning has enabled me to explore cutting-edge technologies and deliver high-quality solutions. Beyond coding, I bring a client-first mindset and a results-oriented approach, ensuring every project meets or exceeds expectations. Currently, I’m open to full-time roles that allow me to contribute to innovative teams while continuing to grow as a Fullstack Developer. When I'm not coding, I enjoy sharing knowledge through teaching and mentoring in software development, fostering collaboration, and empowering others in their tech journeys. Let’s build something great together!
